This is a stripped down version with only the necessary styles and scripts to get it running. Download the full version to start adding components to your dashboard.</p>
<p>All the functionality is for show with the exception of the <strong>Access Management</strong> to the left. This boilerplate comes with a fully functional access control library to manage users/roles/permissions.</p>
<p>Keep in mind it is a work in progress and their may be bugs or other issues I have not come across. I will do my best to fix them as I receive them.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy all of the work I have put into this.

<p><strong>This project is very demanding to keep up with given the rate at which the master Laravel branch changes, so any help is appreciated.</strong></p>
