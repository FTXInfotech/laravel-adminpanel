     * Layout for the Admin LTE backend theme
     *
     * Fixed:               use the class .fixed to get a fixed header and sidebar.
     *                      This makes scrolling affect the content only and put the sidebar and header in a fixed position.
     *
     * Collapsed Sidebar:   use the class .sidebar-collapse to have a collapsed sidebar upon loading.
     *                      Use this if you want the sidebar to be hidden by default.
     *
     * Boxed Layout:        use the class .layout-boxed to get a boxed layout that stretches only to 1250px.
     *                      Provides spaces on both sides of the screen, if the screen is big enough.
     *
     * Top Navigation:      use the class .layout-top-nav to remove the sidebar and have your links at the top navbar.
     *                      Makes the sidebar hover the content when expanded.
     *
     * Sidebar Mini:        Shows the only the icons of the sidebar items when collapsed. Sidebar will not fully collapse.
     *
     * Available options:
     *
     * fixed
     * sidebar-collapse
     * layout-boxed
     * layout-top-nav
     * sidebar-mini
     *
     * Note: you cannot use both layout-boxed and fixed at the same time. Anything else can be mixed together.
